# An Improved BCA

I led a comprehensive redesign of Brooklyn College Academy's website, transforming it from a basic Google Sites platform into a modern, user-centric digital experience built with Vue.js. Leveraging Vue's reactive framework, I created a dynamic single-page application that significantly improves upon the original website's static structure and navigation issues. The original site suffered from information gaps and poor information architecture, making it difficult for students, parents, and faculty to access crucial school information. My Vue.js implementation focuses on delivering a seamless user experience through responsive components, efficient state management, and optimized routing. I reimagined the site's layout to prioritize frequently accessed content while ensuring comprehensive coverage of school information previously missing from the platform. The result is a more efficient, accessible website that better serves the school community's needs, demonstrating both technical proficiency in modern web development and strong user experience design principles.

I hope to someday let this design and build become a reality !
